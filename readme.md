# Basic Calculator

This is my first public application of React native, this application is designed for android, it is a basic calculator for android, this application was based on the youtuber [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XgxF-S00XpU&t=1s).

# How can I start the project?

* First we proceed to install the packages with our favorite package manager
```
npm install
bun install
```

* To start the web in dev mode, you must enter the following command

```
npx expo start
bunx expo start
```
Note: To run the app in development mode you need to have the Expo Go app, to scan the QR it will give you on the console or an Android emulator on your PC.

* To run our production app you will have to do it through EAS Cli, for this I recommend you to follow the steps in the [following documentation from the official Expo website](https://docs.expo.dev/build/setup/)
